To run ITM (propagation model) you'll need to download some files (6GBs: Too big to upload here.)

(Contant nlasorte@ntia.gov if you can't access the terrain database files.)

(Place all the files from the Terrain Folder ("USGS") to the following path --> C:\USGS

Then run the matlab m file: https://github.com/nicklasorte/itm_matlab_example/blob/main/init_ITM_test_rev1.m
